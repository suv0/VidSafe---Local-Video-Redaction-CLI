# VidSafe---Local-Video-Redaction-CLI
VidSafe is a local, offline-first video redaction CLI tool that detects sensitive visual content (blood, gore, wounds) in videos and blurs only the sensitive pixels. It uses state-of-the-art computer vision models (CLIP and CLIPSeg) to identify and mask sensitive regions while preserving the rest of the video content.
